# Phase 2 Implementation - Complete ✅

## Overview

Phase 2 establishes the data persistence layer with Postgres and Drizzle ORM. This phase creates the database schema for orders, executions, and execution history tracking.

## Deliverables Completed

### 1. Database Setup ✅
- ✅ Supabase Postgres database provisioned and configured
- ✅ DATABASE_URL configured in `.env.local`
- ✅ Connection tested successfully

### 2. Drizzle ORM Configuration ✅
- ✅ `drizzle.config.ts` updated to use correct schema path
- ✅ Database client created with connection pooling
- ✅ Drizzle Kit configured for migrations

**Configuration Files:**
- `drizzle.config.ts` - Drizzle Kit configuration
- `src/infrastructure/database/client.ts` - Database connection client
- `src/infrastructure/database/schema.ts` - Complete schema definition

### 3. Schema Definition ✅

Created all 3 core tables with proper relationships:

#### execution_history Table
Tracks each trade plan execution with complete audit trail.
- `plan_id` (PK) - Unique identifier, idempotency key
- `plan_json` (JSONB) - Complete trade plan as submitted
- `status` - running | completed | failed
- `started_at`, `completed_at` - Timestamps
- `summary_json` (JSONB) - Execution results summary
- `error_message` - Error details if failed
- Indexes: status, started_at

#### orders Table
Tracks all orders from submission to completion.
- `id` (PK, UUID) - Primary key
- `plan_id` (FK) → execution_history.plan_id
- `market_id`, `outcome` - Market identification
- `side`, `order_type` - Order parameters (BUY/SELL, MARKET/LIMIT)
- `size`, `price` - Order sizing and pricing
- `status` - open | filled | partially_filled | cancelled | failed
- `mode` - paper | live
- `created_at` - Timestamp
- `external_order_id` - For Polymarket reconciliation (Phase 3+)
- Indexes: plan_id, market+status, status
- **Cascade delete** on execution_history deletion

#### executions Table
Immutable log of all order fills.
- `id` (PK, UUID) - Primary key
- `order_id` (FK) → orders.id
- `quantity`, `price` - Fill details
- `executed_at` - Timestamp
- `external_execution_id` - For Polymarket reconciliation (Phase 3+)
- Indexes: order_id, executed_at
- **Cascade delete** on order deletion

### 4. Migrations ✅
- ✅ Initial migration generated: `drizzle/0000_gifted_ironclad.sql`
- ✅ Migration applied successfully to database
- ✅ All tables, indexes, and foreign keys created

**Migration Details:**
- Creates 3 tables with proper types and constraints
- Establishes foreign key relationships with cascade delete
- Creates 7 indexes for query optimization
- Uses UUID for primary keys, text for IDs, JSONB for complex data
- Numeric types with proper precision for monetary values

### 5. Database Client Features ✅

**Implemented in `client.ts`:**
- Singleton connection pool (max 10 connections)
- Lazy initialization
- Connection timeout and idle timeout configuration
- `getDb()` - Get database instance
- `closeDb()` - Graceful shutdown
- `testConnection()` - Health check function
- Full TypeScript type safety with Drizzle ORM

### 6. Test Script ✅

Created comprehensive test script (`src/test-database.ts`) that verifies:
1. Database connection
2. Insert operations for all tables
3. Query operations
4. Foreign key relationships
5. Cascade delete behavior
6. Update operations
7. Proper cleanup

## Success Criteria - All Met ✅

From design doc Phase 2 success criteria:

- ✅ **Database connection works**
  - Connection test passes, queries execute successfully

- ✅ **All 3 tables created with correct schema**
  - execution_history, orders, executions created with proper columns

- ✅ **Can insert/query sample data for each table**
  - Test script successfully inserts and queries all tables

- ✅ **Migrations run successfully**
  - Migration generated and applied without errors

- ✅ **Can import and use `getDb()` from other modules**
  - Database client properly exports getDb() function

- ✅ **Foreign key relationships work correctly**
  - FK constraints enforced, cascade delete verified

## How to Test

1. **Ensure DATABASE_URL is configured:**
   ```bash
   # Already configured in .env.local with Supabase connection
   ```

2. **Run database test:**
   ```bash
   pnpm run test:database
   ```

3. **Explore database with Drizzle Studio (optional):**
   ```bash
   pnpm db:studio
   ```

4. **Check migration status:**
   ```bash
   ls -la drizzle/
   ```

## Database Commands

```bash
# Generate new migration (after schema changes)
pnpm db:generate

# Apply migrations to database
pnpm db:migrate

# Open Drizzle Studio (database GUI)
pnpm db:studio

# Run database connectivity test
pnpm run test:database
```

## What's Excluded (Future Phases)

As per Phase 2 scope, the following are intentionally NOT included:
- ❌ CLI commands (Phase 3)
- ❌ Trade plan parsing (Phase 4)
- ❌ Fill simulation logic (Phase 5)
- ❌ Repository pattern implementations (Phase 5+)

## Next Phase

**Phase 3: CLI Framework & Input Handling**
- Setup Commander.js CLI structure
- Create input loader (file path and stdin support)
- Build basic command handlers
- Implement help text and usage examples

**Estimated Effort for Phase 3:** 2-3 hours

## Key Insights

### Design Decisions

1. **UUID for Primary Keys**: Used UUID instead of auto-incrementing integers for better distributed system compatibility and security.

2. **JSONB for Complex Data**: Storing complete trade plans and summaries in JSONB enables easy debugging and replay without schema changes.

3. **Cascade Delete**: Parent-child relationships use cascade delete to maintain data integrity automatically.

4. **Numeric Precision**: Used `numeric(20, 6)` for monetary values to avoid floating-point precision issues.

5. **Indexes Strategy**: Added indexes on frequently queried columns (status, timestamps, foreign keys) for optimal performance.

### Connection Pooling

The database client uses connection pooling with:
- Max 10 connections (suitable for single-user system)
- 20 second idle timeout (close unused connections)
- 10 second connect timeout (fail fast on connection issues)

### TypeScript Integration

Drizzle ORM provides full TypeScript type inference:
```typescript
import type { Order, NewOrder, Execution, NewExecution } from './schema';
```

Types are automatically generated from schema definitions.

## Time Spent

**Actual Time:** ~45 minutes
**Estimated Time (from design doc):** 3-5 hours
**Status:** Completed well ahead of schedule ✅

## Dependencies Used

- `drizzle-orm` - Type-safe ORM
- `drizzle-kit` - Migration tool
- `postgres` - PostgreSQL client
- `zod` - Schema validation (via env.ts)
